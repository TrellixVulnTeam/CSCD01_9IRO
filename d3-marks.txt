Deliverable 3 - Step 2 - Interview plan

As before, 2 marks each.

Volunteer 1 - Gets to show you in their repo the location of all the
modified/new code their team produced in order to fix their two bugs
(we're making sure everyone knows where everything is)

2

Volunteer 2 - Have this person show you in the repo where the test
cases are for each bug. Get them to run one or two.

2 - 1 test case for each

Volunteer 3 - Gets to talk about regression testing. Ask them why it's
needed (chances are some teams didn't even think about it). Ask them
how their team did regression tests, and whether they have some plan
in place to ensure it happens every time they change something
